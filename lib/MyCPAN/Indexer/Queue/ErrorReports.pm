=head1 NAME

MyCPAN::Indexer::Queue::ErrorReports - Try to index distributions with error reports

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use this in backpan_indexer.pl by specifying it as the queue class:

	# in backpan_indexer.config
	queue_class  MyCPAN::Indexer::Queue::ErrorReports

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class returns a list of Perl distributions for the BackPAN
indexer to process. It selects the distributions that had previous
indexing errors by extracting the distribution path from the error
report. If the distribution isn't in the same place it was during
the original indexing, it won't be in the queue.

=item get_queue

C<get_queue> sets the key C<queue> in C<$Notes> hash reference. It
finds all of the tarballs or zip archives in under the directories
named in C<backpan_dir> and C<merge_dirs> in the configuration.

It specifically skips files that end in C<.txt.gz> or C<.data.gz>
since PAUSE creates those meta files near the actual module
installations.

If the C<organize_dists> configuration value is true, it also copies
any distributions it finds into a PAUSE-like structure using the
value of the C<pause_id> configuration to create the path.
