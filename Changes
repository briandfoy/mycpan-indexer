	* Initial release of my BackPAN Indexer

0.15_01 - Mon Sep  8 23:25:15 2008
	* Big changes to where everything is. I've decouple several
	components into separate, pluggable classes. If you don't 
	like the classes that backpan_indexer.pl uses, change them
	in the config file. Look in MyCPAN::Indexer::Tutorial for
	an explanation of the different classes. Docs are weak at
	the moment, but getting better.
	* This version also uses a Tk interface. That's fine for 
	right now, but eventually that should be an optional thing.

0.11_01 - Fri Aug 29 10:26:47 2008
	* Added parallelism. You can now index things in parallel. In
	the backpan_indexer.pl config, add a directive for parallel_jobs
	* Adds more run info for operating system, perl version,
	and so on
